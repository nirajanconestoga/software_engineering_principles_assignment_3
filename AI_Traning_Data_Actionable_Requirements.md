# AI Training Data - Actionable Requirements

## Project Overview
Our client, an AI developer, is using web scraping to generate training data for their models. They have two key challenges:
- **Categorization of training questions and answers separately.**
- **Ensuring the dataset is balanced and free from biases.**

This document outlines actionable requirements, along with prioritization for structured implementation.
